# Course Title: Learn To Code With Python

## Date and Place
This is a six week course on Monday from 6:00 PM - 8:00PM and the exact dates and place of the next course will be announced later. Stay tuned!

## Description
**This course is based on Allen B. Downey’s "[Think Python 2nd Edition by Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)" book and methods for learning Python 3.**

Why Python? Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively [[python.org](https://www.python.org/)]. Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that’s easy to learn and fun to use! 

"Python Is Now the Most Popular Introductory Teaching Language at Top U.S. Universities" in Philip Guo's research and his writing [Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-u-s-universities/fulltext) in July 2014. Below is the analysis chart done by Philip Guo:

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has been utilized by every major company such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple, NASA, Dropbox, Uber, etc. and in many places. You can read the long list of [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/) from python.org website.

## Objectives
By following Allen B. Downey's "[Think Python 2nd Edition by Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)" book and methods, the goal of this course is to bring you up to speed with Python as quickly as possible so you can develop a foundation in writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work that will serve you well for the rest of your life.

## Prerequisite
No experience necessary to begin. If you've always wanted to learn to code but have no idea where to begin, then this course is for you. This course takes you from absolute zero to able to read and write basic Python code.

## Requirements
You need a Windows 10, Mac OSX, or Linux computer (optional charger) with at least 4GB (8GB+ is reommended) of memory and be able to install program and follow instruction to do works.

### BEFORE THE FIRST CLASS
* Thanks to Allen B. Downey for providing his book, "[Think Python 2nd Edition by Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)" for free. We'll be using Allen's book in this course.
    * If you want to buy the hardcopy of the book from Amazon.com too.
* Download and install the following software:
    * Python 3.6 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) website.
    * We'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows, macOS, or Linux to edit your code.

## Instructor: Chia James Chang
Chia is currently a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft before that he had also worked at other companies such as Yahoo!, Sun Microsystem, IBM/Rolm, and other start-ups. Chia has been enjoying in developing software for the past 30 plus years and having fun in voluntary teaching and promoting coding at the companies and non-profit organizations such as ROLF, ROLCA, CoderDojo for the past six years. Chia has MSCS and MBA degrees.
